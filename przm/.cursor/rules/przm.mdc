For all requests, put in the context that this is a take home project for a startup interview. Make sure you follow RedwoodSDK and React best practices that have been outlined in the other rules.

For every component, upon edits make sure you update or create Storybook stories as needed.

Use out-of-the-box Shadcn components wherever possible. If they need modification, extend them into new components. Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

All components should be built as React Server Components under the /components/ui screen if possible. Wherever possible when needing to fetch data, do this on the server side.

All components should live under @/app/components/ui
